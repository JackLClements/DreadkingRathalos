# DreadkingRathalos
A discord bot for a private channel. Uses the JDA library (wraps Discord HTTPS/API requests).
Current functionality includes basic modding behaviour and the ability to pull and display data for Splatoon 2

## TODO
1. Implement mod behaviour
2. Look into listener threading and potential concurrency issues
3. Look into spoofing SplatNet 2 login portal, currently stuck at 1st layer with prototyped features and working SHA-256 hash
