# DreadkingRathalos
A discord bot for a private channel. Uses the JDA library (wraps Discord HTTPS/API requests).

## TODO
1. Implement default behaviour
2. Voice channel commands
3. Thread user requests
4. Figure out how to add remote repositories from Maven or Switch to gradle (easier)
5. Run on remote server
