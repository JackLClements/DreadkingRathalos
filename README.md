## TODO
1. Clean up code snippets and commenting pending a 1.0 release
2. Begin to work on scaling code up for multiple users. Current issues include the persistence of playlists after removal of audio channels.
3. Look into potential concurrency issues for long-form text commands
4. Look into spoofing SplatNet 2 login portal, currently stuck at 1st layer with prototyped features and working SHA-256 hash. NOTE - ON BACKBURNER SINCE NINTENDO PATCHED THEIR SECUIRTY HOLE.
